I’m starting to build it. It’ll be awesome.</p>\n<h1>Do we need another podcast client?</h1>\n<p>We probably don’t, but I can’t find anything I’m happy with.</p>\n<p>A quick look at the Windows store, and there doesn’t appear to be a single podcast client with more than a 2 star rating. Windows Phone isn’t much better. There’s the “Podcasts” app by Microsoft, but not much else.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using the Microsoft Podcasts app for a while and I have a few issues with it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It’s buggy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Episodes don’t get marked as played reliably</li>\n<li>It decided to stop updating Hanselminutes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slow</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load time is slow since it appears to try to refresh all feeds on load</li>\n<li>\n<p>While it’s loading feeds the UI is pretty much useless</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It jumps around, and shows some partially rendered stuff</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can’t search feeds</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>My favorite podcast is .Net Rocks, which just hit 1100 episodes, but the Podcasts app doesn’t have any kind of search</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This probably doesn’t help the load times, but that’s another issue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All data is local to phone</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to be able to start listening to a podcast on my PC at work, and when I get in the car it should resume where I left off</li>\n<li>Similarly marked as played should be synced between devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It gets confused by podcasts that only leave a handful of episodes in the RSS feed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A good app would be able to cache and remember old entries, ideally while having logic to detect and handle updated entries gracefully</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What’s been done?</h1>\n<p>Well, the domain has been purchased. Beyond that, not much. I’ve written this post, and thought about the feature set and issues I’d like to resolve.</p>\n<h1>What’s the plan?</h1>\n<p>I’ll be writing one post per week here while I’m working on ListenCat.
