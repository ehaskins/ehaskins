Managing and listening to audio podcasts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cloudy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All episodes should be cached in the cloud lands, including played/unplayed and current position in the episode.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seamless</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whatever device I hit play on should resume where I left off on my other device.</li>\n<li>I should never have to select the next thing to play. Something should always be queued.</li>\n<li>The next few episodes in my queue should be available instantly and without streaming on every device I use.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What’s next</h1>\n<p>My next post will be looking at the feature set of a minimally viable product, probably followed by one on technical decisions and architecture.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ListenCat - Goals","date":"March 05, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2015-03-04 ListenCat - Goals/"}}}
