Let's review the goals for ListenCat laid out in my last post.

> 1. Great at one thing
> 	- ListenCat is for one thing only. Managing and listening to audio podcasts.
> 2. Cloudy
> 	- All episodes should be cached in the cloud lands, including played/unplayed and current position in the episode.
> 3. Seamless
> 	- Whatever device I hit play on should resume where I left off on my other device.
> 	- I should never have to select the next thing to play. Something should always be queued.
> 	- The next few episodes in my queue should be available instantly and without streaming on every device I use.
